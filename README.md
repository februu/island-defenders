# **Island Defenders**

## ðŸ‘½ About

**Island Defenders** is an isometric tower defense game which is played on randomly generated map. It started as a school project in winter 2022. It took about 4 weeks and at least 15 litres of Lipton Ice Tea to get it finished.

## ðŸ“œ Rules

Main Objective
Your main objective is to defend The Dark Altar which is located in the middle of the map.

### Enemies

There are two types of enemies: slimes and wasps. Wasps are quick but fragile. Slimes are slower but have more hp. Regardless of the type, enemies will always go towards the middle attacking mines and turrets encountered on their path. When they get near The Dark Altar they will attack it and you will lose one of your precious lives.

### Turrets

There are four types of turrets. Two of them are focused on dealing damage (Basic Turret, Fire Turret) and two of them are more support-oriented (Ice Turret, Magic Turret). Ice turrets slow enemies down and magic turrets stun them in place for three seconds.

### Mines

Mines generate 20 crystals every 5 seconds. Crystals are in-game currency to buy new buildings like turrets. Mines can only be placed on special tiles which are randomly distributed around the map.

### Gameplay

To build turrets or mines just right-click selected tile. Building menu will open. You can also hover over different building to get more info about their current stats. After you lose all of your lives and the game is over, your final score is calculated based on amount of mined crystals, amount of monsters killed and difficulty level.
